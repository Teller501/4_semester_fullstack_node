        <h3>Frontend Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The structure of the frontend is important, because it enhances the
            maintainability, scalability and perfomance of your project. In this
            project, we seperate the public files from the backend, and the
            frontend is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and
            understand. The frontend is structured in the following way:

        <p>
            In the public directory, we have 4 subdirectories (assets,
            components, pages and util).
            <br /><br />
            The assets directory contains all the static files, such as css,
            fonts, images and js files.
            <br /><br />
            The components directory contains all the reusable components, such
            as the header and footer.
            <br /><br />
            The pages directory contains all the pages of the website, such as
            the homepage, express, javascriptFundamentals, misc,
            nodeFundamentals etc...
            <br /><br />
            The util directory contains all the utility files, such as the
            codeExecutor and typeEffect. These files are used to execute code
            and create a typewriter effect. Having the utility files in a
            sperate directory makes it easy to use accross multiple pages and
            scripts.

        <h3>Redirection approaches</h3>
        <h4>Server Side Redirection</h4>
        <p>
            Server Side Redirections is when the server responds with a HTTP
            code and a header for 'Location' with the url to redirect to.
        </p>
        <h4>Client Side Redirection</h4>
        <p>
            In one of the ways with Client Side Redirection is that JavaScript
            handles it, with the
            <code class="language-javascript">window.location.href</code>
            assignment, dynamically redirecting the user.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-snippet language-javascript" id="code-snippet-11">
setTimeout(() => (window.location.href = "/publicsquare"), 3000);       
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the example above, we set a timeout for 3 seconds from when the
            page with the script is loaded, to then redirect to '/publicsquare'
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="documentation-item">
        <h3>Client Side Renderig (CSR) vs Server Side Rendering (SSR)</h3>
        <p>
            Client Side Rendering is when a client request a site and the code
            is sent to the client and then processed and turned into the page we
            view.
            <br /><br />

            Server Side Rendering is when a client request a site and the server
            processes the code and sends the page to the client. The client then
            gets the page instantly.
            <br /><br />
            The difference between the two is that with CSR, the client has to
            wait for the code to be processed, but with SSR, the client gets the
            page instantly. However with CSR, the client only has to request the
            data, not the whole page, which makes the page faster at navigating.

            <br /><br />
            There are several arguments for and against both:
        </p>
        <h4>Load Time</h4>
        <p>
            <b>SSR</b> <br />
            Loads the page faster, as the server sends the full page. However,
            it can be slower if the server is slow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CSR</b> <br />
            Page loads slower, as the client has to process the code. However,
            afterwards the page is faster at navigating, because the client only
            has to request the data, not the whole page.
        </p>
        <h4>Resources Spent</h4>
        <p>
            <b>SSR</b> <br />
            The server handles the processing, so the client doesn't have to,
            especially if the clients device is slow. However, the server has to
            be powerful to handle the processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CSR</b> <br />
            Releases the server of the load of processing the code, but is not
            ideal for slower networks or devices.
        </p>
        <h4>SEO</h4>
        <p>
            <b>SSR</b> <br />
            Far better for SEO as webcrawlers can read the whole content of the
            page. It requires resources to render the page for web crawlers and
            bots.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CSR</b> <br />
            Better dynamic content, but not as good for SEO, because it is hard
            for webcrawlers to read the content.
        </p>
        <h4>CORS</h4>
        <p>
            <b>SSR</b><br />
            CORS is administered by the browser, so they do not involve browsers
            with server to server communication. This means that CORS is not a
            problem with SSR.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CSR</b><br />
            Has to deal with CORS, like setting headers or configuring the
            backend for allowing CORS.
        </p>

        <h3>Code Placement and Application Performance</h3>
        <p>
            When declaring and initilazing variables in the global scope, it is
            available throughout all of your project, which will cause higher
            memory usage.
            <br />
            Using the local scope will make the code a lot more readable and
            organizable, and the memory usage will be lower.
            <br /><br />
            Another topic is lazy loading, that is when you only load the
            modules and scripts when you need them. This will make the initial
            page load faster. This is especially useful when you have a lot of
            modules and scripts, and you don't need all of them at the same
            time.
            <br /><br />
            A thing to always consider is the size of your modules/scripts. If a
            script is too big, consider splitting it to another file.
            <br /><br />
            Asynchronous programming can also increase perfomance of your
            application, as you don't block the main thread.

        <h3>Importance of Clean Code</h3>
        <p>
            Clean code is essential, especially when working with others, there
            has to be some kind of standard in how you write your code.
            <br /><br />
            Code should be written with readability in mind, so that others (and
            most importantly yourself!) can read and understand it. <br /><br />
            It should also be kept simple, so the application doesn't get
            unnessesarily complex. So chose the most simple way of achieving the
            desired goal, and avoid overengineering. <br /><br />
            It should also be well organized, so that it is easy to navigate and
            understand. <br /><br />
