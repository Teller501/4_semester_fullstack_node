        <h3>The Three REST Conventions</h3>
        <h4>1. Using the right HTTP verb</h4>
        <p>
            When designing and creating a REST API, it is crucial to know about
            the HTTP Verbs that are used to retrieve, create, edit and delete
            data in your system.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Ordering</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>GET</li>
            <li>POST</li>
            <li>PUT</li>
            <li>PATCH</li>
            <li>DELETE</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In the ordering it is also understanded that if you have multiple
            GET on the same resource, that the first is always the one that
            retrieves all resources, and then you can be specific on the ones to
            search for ID for example. The same goes for the other methods, the
            first is always the general one, and the latter are more specific.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Naming that maps to collections in your system</h4>
        <p>
            To correctly design and implement a REST API, it is important to use
            nouns in plural that corresponds to your resources in your system.
            In the example it is stated that even when retrieving a single
            drink, we use '/drinks'. We always use plural form on nouns for
            REST, this is to be explicit that we are working with collections.

            alt="a REST API design of ai models example"
        />
        <p>
            In the example above is a designed REST API model, that expresses
            the three REST conventions by using the correct HTTP verb, ordering
            the methods correctly, and an appropriate naming. It can also be
            noted that every endpoint is in plural, and indicates we are working
            with a 'drinks' collection.

        <h3>Fetching</h3>
        <p>
            Fetching is a way of accessing data from other webpages and API's,
            and is typically used to retrieve data and displaying or
            manipulating it. Fetch utilizes promises, which is a great way to
            use asynchrounous programming in JavaScript. Fetch is a modern
            replacement for XMLHttpRequest, and is much more powerful and
            flexible.
            <br /><br />
            <code class="language-javascript">fetch()</code> returns a promise
            on the Response object, that can then be used in many different
            ways. Typically it is used to retrieve JSON that then can be
            unpacked and displayed or used.

            <br /><br />

            Here is an example of a fetch call on our own backend express
            server:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="code-snippet language-javascript" id="code-snippet-1">
// backend
app.get("/api/greeting", (req, res) => {
    const providedName = req.query.name;

    res.send({ data: `hello ${providedName}` });
});


// frontend
const nameInput = document.getElementById("name-input");
const greetingH2 = document.getElementById("greeting-text");
const nameBtn = document.getElementById("name-btn");

nameBtn.addEventListener("click", showGreeting);

function showGreeting() {
    const name = nameInput.value;
    fetch(`/api/greeting?name=${name}`)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((result) => {
            greetingH2.textContent = result.data;
        });
}
</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            In this example, we have a backend route '/api/greeting' where we
            extract the query parameter 'name' then we send a response as JSON.
            The response looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="code-snippet language-json" id="code-snippet-1">
{
    "data": "hello anders"
}                   
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            With this data, in the frontend we prompt the user for input, then
            fetching on the endpoint with the specified name, and displaying it
            to the user. Try it!
        </p>
        <input placeholder="Your name here" id="name-input" />
        <button id="name-btn">Get Greeting</button>

        <h2 id="greeting-text"></h2>
    </div>
